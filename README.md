# OSClassPortfolio
A portfolio submission for my Operating Systems class at Southern New Hampshire University

*Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
--The Gaming Room client wanted to develop a game called "Draw It or Lose It", a web-based game resembling Win, Lose, or Draw. They required support for multiple teams and players, real-time rendering, and unique identifiers for games, teams, and players.
*What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
--I effectively outlined the project scope, requirements, contraints, and architecture. I provided clear expectations and actionable recommendations based on platform evaluations.
*What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
--Working throuhg the design document helped me in organizing thoughts and structuring the software design process. It ensured whole understanding and facilitated effective solution formulation.
*If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
--I would have focused on providing more detailed explanations and examples in the domain model and evaluation sections to enhance clarity.
*How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
*How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
--I really had to compare the technology that needed to be used and choose the best OS for what the client needed.
